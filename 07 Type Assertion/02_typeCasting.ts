// Type Casting
// Type casting is a way to tell the compiler "trust me, I know what I'm doing." It's like type assertion in other languages. TypeScript allows you to override its inferred and analyzed view of types in any way you want to. This is done using the "as" keyword.
//

let abc = Number("12");
console.log(typeof abc);
